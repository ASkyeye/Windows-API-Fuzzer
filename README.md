# Windows-API-Fuzzer
Designed to learn OS specific anti-emulation patterns by fuzzing the Windows API.


## Example usage

Truffle needs a DLL, searched first using GetModuleHandle, then LoadLibrary, to perform analysis on.

Truffle will execute arbitrary code, please run ONLY in a VM!

To adjust the timeout of a function, specify the timeout (-t) in ms.

truffle.exe -dll crypt32.dll 

truffle.exe -dll crypt32.dll -t 6000
